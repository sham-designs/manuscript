Project summary:
This is the first project I submitted for my class called “Typography and Interaction 1” at Parsons MPS CD.
I chose the reading “Is Graphic Design White?” because being an immigrant here in the US, it really spoke to me. I wrote a response to the reading, and this repo contains the code for the final sketch of the reading + response i did, using HTML and CSS.

How to view the project:
Open the HTML file in a web browser. Only optimised for desktop at the moment.
